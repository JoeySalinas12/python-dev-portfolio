# ASCII Art

ASCII art can be seen all across the internet, but I've always that in order for someone to create this art they must have spent countless hours to everything just right. With this script you can convert any jpg image into ASCII art in a matter of seconds.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Example execution
   `python asciiArt --filepath "asciiArt/src/images/<image name>" --output_filepath "output/filepath/ascii_image.txt"`

 __Note__ 
- "--filepath" can be shortened to  "-f"
- "output_filepath" can be shortened to "-o"
